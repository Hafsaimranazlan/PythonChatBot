Programmers from every corner of the software in-\\ndustry have found Python’s focus on developer productivity and software quality to be\\na strategic advantage in projects both large and small.\\nWhether you are new to programming or are a professional developer, this book’s goal\\nis to bring you quickly up to speed on the fundamentals of the core Python language.\\nAfter reading this book, you will know enough about Python to apply it in whatever\\napplication domains you choose to explore.\\nBy design, this book is a tutorial that focuses on the core Python language itself, rather\\nthan specific applications of it.

In addition, the book Python Pocket Reference\\nprovides additional reference materials not included here, and it is designed to sup-\\nplement this book.\\nBecause of this book’s foundations focus, though, it is able to present Python funda-\\nmentals with more depth than many programmers see when first learning the language.\\nAnd because it’s based upon a three-day Python training class with quizzes and exer-\\ncises throughout, this book serves as a self-paced introduction to the language.\\nxxxi'),\n",

This edition:\\n• Covers both Python 3.0 and \\nPython 2.6—it emphasizes 3.0, but notes differences\\nin 2.6\\n• Includes a set of new chapters mainly targeted at advanced core-language topics\\n• Reorganizes some existing material and expands it with new examples for clarity\\nAs I write this edition in 2009, Python comes in two flavors—version 3.0 is an emerging\\nand incompatible mutation of the language, and 2.6 retains backward compatibility\\nwith the vast body of existing Python code. Although Python 3 is viewed as the future\\nof Python, Python 2 is still widely used and will be supported in parallel with Python\\n3 for years to come. While 3.0 is largely the same language, it runs almost no code\\nwritten for prior releases (the mutation of print from statement to function alone,\\naesthetically sound as it may be, breaks nearly every Python program ever written).'),\n",

A vast\\namount of existing code was written for Python 2, and it won’t be going away any time\\nsoon. And while newcomers to the language can focus on Python 3, anyone who must\\nuse code written in the past needs to keep one foot in the Python 2 world today. Since\\nit may be years before all third-party libraries and extensions are ported to Python 3,\\nthis fork might not be entirely temporary.\\nCoverage for Both 3.0 and 2.6\\nTo address this dichotomy and to meet the needs of all potential readers, this edition\\nof this book has been updated to cover both Python 3.0 and Python 2.6 (and later'),\n",

I’ll also freely introduce new\\nfeatures, such as the nonlocal statement in 3.0 and the string format method in 2.6 and\\n3.0, and will point out when such extensions are not present in older Pythons.\\nIf you are learning Python for the first time and don’t need to use any legacy code, I'),\n",

When typing Python programs,\\neither interactively or into a text file, be sure to start all your unnested statements\\nin column 1 (that is, all the way to the left).

Python makes the variable a reference the\\nobject 3 and makes b\\n reference the same object as a, as in Figure 6-2; as before, the last\\nassignment then sets a to a completely different object (in this case, the integer 5, which\\nis the result of the + expression). It does not change b as a side effect. In fact, there is\\nno way to ever overwrite the value of the object 3—as introduced in Chapter 4, integers\\nare immutable and thus can never be changed in-place.\\nOne way to think of this is that, unlike in some languages, in Python variables are always\\npointers to objects, not labels of changeable memory areas: setting a variable to a new\\nvalue does not alter the original object, but rather causes the variable to reference an\\nentirely different object. The net effect is that assignment to a variable can impact only\\nthe single variable being assigned. When mutable objects and in-place changes enter'),\n",

For instance, an assignment to an offset in a list actually\\nchanges the list object itself in-place, rather than generating a brand new list object.\\nFor objects that support such in-place changes, you need to be more aware of shared\\nreferences, since a change from one name may impact others.\\nTo further illustrate, let’s take another look at the list objects introduced in Chap-\\nter 4. Recall that lists, which do support in-place assignments to positions, are simply\\ncollections of other objects, coded in square brackets:\\n>>> L1 = [2, 3, 4]\\n>>> L2 = L1\\nFigure 6-3.
